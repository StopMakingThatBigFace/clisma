## Migrations table

clisma records applied migrations in a ClickHouse table (default:
`schema_migrations`). Each row includes:

- `version` (timestamp prefix)
- `name` (filename suffix)
- `checksum` (sha256 of file contents)
- `hostname` (machine name that applied the migration)
- `applied_by` (user who applied the migration)
- `cli_version` (clisma CLI version)
- `applied_at` (server time)

## Checksums

If a migration file changes after being applied, clisma stops with a checksum
mismatch error. Create a new migration instead of editing the old one.
