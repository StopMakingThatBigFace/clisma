Clisma uses an HCL config file to define environments and migration settings.

The root blocks are:

- `env "name"` for a database environment
- `variable "name"` for user-defined inputs

## Minimum config

```hcl
env "local" {
  url = "http://default:password@localhost:8123/mydb"

  migrations {
    dir = "migrations"
  }
}
```

## env "name"

```hcl
env "local" {
  url = "http://default:password@localhost:8123/mydb"
  cluster_name = "prod-cluster"

  migrations {
    dir = "migrations"
    table_name = "schema_migrations"
    replication_path = "/clickhouse/tables/prod/schema_migrations"
    vars = {
      ttl_days = 30
    }
  }
}
```

Fields:

- `url` (string) Connection string. Supports `env("NAME")`.
- `cluster_name` (string, optional) Cluster name used for template context and replicated tracking. Required when your server has clusters configured.
- `exclude` (list<string>, optional) Patterns to ignore.
- `migrations` (block) Migration settings.

## migrations

- `dir` (string) Path to migrations directory.
- `table_name` (string, optional) Custom tracking table.
- `replication_path` (string, optional) Replication path for the tracking table.
- `vars` (object, optional) Variables for Handlebars templates.

## variable "name"

```hcl
variable "ttl_days" {
  type = string
  default = "30"
  description = "Default TTL"
}
```
