Clisma is a ClickHouse migration tool with templating support and environment configuration. You use the CLI for day-to-day workflows, or the core package for programmatic control.

## What it does

- Applies SQL migrations in order and tracks them in ClickHouse.
- Supports Handlebars templating with auto-detected cluster context.
- Reads environment-specific configuration from `clisma.hcl`.

## Inspiration

This project borrows ideas from tools you may already know:

- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for the simple, friendly CLI experience.
- [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/) for templated migrations and config-driven environments.

> Why the weird name?

> It is a little joke: ClickHouse + Prisma -\> clisma. There is no full schema management here (yet), but the vibe is similar.

## Next steps

- Follow the [Getting started](./getting-started) guide.
- Define your environments in [Configuration](./configuration/overview).
- Learn about [Templates](./migrations/templates) for advanced SQL.
